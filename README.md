# CUDA_GraphSearching
For the greatest assignment in the course,investigate algorithm for efficient searching the mapping.

#### Description
This CUDA file is used to count the mapping of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in a gigantic graph.

#### 1. Chemistry is great
First approach is following chemistry rules.

Investigating algorithms for efficient searching is good here rather than brute force searching. Using the property of chemistry rules, the amount of data searching is greatly reduced compare with brute force.

#### 2. No More Chemistry
Second approach is NOT following chemistry rules which means a pure graph searching.
